# Review-on-Arrythmia-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Cardiovascular diseases like arrhythmia are a significant health concern worldwide, affecting both elderly and young population due to lifestyle changes. Early diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia by trained cardiologists is vital to prevent heart ailments and save lives. With the growth of wearable devices and a dearth of qualified cardiologists required to analyze the vast amounts of data collected, automated arrhythmia detection by Machine Learning (ML) technique have become very popular in recent years. In this study, we will review the literature and described standard ML studies in arrhythmia classification. While ML techniques do demonstrate very good metrics, ML classifiers like Linear SVM, Kernelized SVM, k-nearest-neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, PCA. We need preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis. While some ML techniques do need noise filtering and determination of other features, many of them can work with raw data and hence are ideally suited over their ML counterparts for real time classification. We thus conclude that ML methods offer inherent advantages and flexibility for automated arrhythmia classification. This review aggregates the niche features of leading ML studies.
